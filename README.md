# Slipstream

##### Front end capstone project at Nashville Software School

A social app where users can search for and add movies and TV shows to their personal queue, write reviews to share with other users, and find information on where to stream the media of their choice.

This solo project is the culmination of my time in the front-end segment of the NSS full stack web developer program.

The deployed site is available at http://slipstream.john-achor.com.

#### Technologies used in this project:

- HTML (as JSX)
- CSS (as Sass)
- JavaScript
- React.js
- axios
- Firebase (hosting and data storage)
- Bootstrap 3 (as `react-bootstrap`)

# How to use:

Upon accessing the site for the first time, you will be presented with a login prompt.  Use the `Register a new account` link to head over to the registration form.  Upon filling out the form, click `Register` and you should be automatically logged in.  On future logins, the email and password you provided will be used.

Once you are logged in, you will see the app's main view. From here you can access most of the app's functionality from the navbar.  The different views and their detailed explanations are listed below.

## Dashboard

### Activity Feed

### Friends List and Options

## My Queue

## My Reviews

## Search

## Item Detail

Generally not directly accessible, this view is used whenever the "See item detail" button is clicked on a media item in any of the other views.
